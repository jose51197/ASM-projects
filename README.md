This repo is meant to host some second semester projects I've worked on by myself, which I really enjoyed
- Pango is a game where you need to align 3 diamonds by pushing them while you run away from a bear which follows you
- Ralph is a file compressor that uses a simple algorithm which counter the number of apereances of a byte and works under these rules:
	* Count the number of time a byte appears
	* Order them by most apereances
	* Assign the top 15 bytes a 4 bit code
	* Replace them with that code and when the code is not on the top use 1111 and the byte
- Fill is a recursive fill of an image, similar to the paint can on MS Paint
- Calendar performs date related operations
